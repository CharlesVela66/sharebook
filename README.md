## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project was developed between **January 2025 â€“ August 2025**.  
While the initial MVP features were built, this version has been **archived** as the developer has grown in skill and is now focusing on new projects with better infrastructure and design.

I may revisit ShareBook in the future with a fresh tech stack and architecture.
